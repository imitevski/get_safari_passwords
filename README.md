# Get Safari Passwords (macOS) and save into CVS format
The script was taken from https://discussions.agilebits.com/discussion/30286/mrcs-convert-to-1password-utility/p1. The script runs through all the saved passwords in safari, and it saves them all in CVS format on the desktop.

Instructions:
1. Go to System Preferences > Accessibility > Privacy and allow Script Editor to control your computer. 
2. Run the script `Get_Safari12_Passwords.applescript`. This will open safari password manager, and you will need to enter your password. 
3. Script loops through all the passwords, and at the end, it saves them in CVS format on the desktop.
4. You can now import your file in your desired password manager.
